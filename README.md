# Zip Code mapping
  # Development Enivironment
  A javascript/HTML development environment is easy to set up. I used the code editor brackets, which has a live server to run the website.
  # Database
  The database I used is called zippopotamus and contains data on zipcodes. https://www.zippopotam.us/
  # Resources
  I followed the tutorials on https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=javascript&topic=any. They were mostly helpful but a little bit confusing. I mostly copied the code and then dissected it myself to understand what was really going on.
  # Stretch Challenge
  The data in my program comes from a public server.
